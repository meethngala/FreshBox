# FreshBox
Description:
The Adelaide Hills farm supplies boxes of fresh fruit and vegetable trays to customers.  For this Programming Project, define the class FreshBox that contains exactly 4 trays of fruits or vegetables and recipe brochures. Fruits and vegetables have names and any other attributes that you think may be appropriate. Add appropriate constructor, set, and get methods. Also write a method called toString()that returns as a String the complete contents of a FreshBox. Next, write a main method that creates a FreshBox with four trays of fruits or vegetables randomly selected from this list: 
• Banana 
• Apple 
• Cauliflower 
• Potato 
• Capsicum 
For now, you can assume that the list contains exactly five types of fruits or vegetables.  Next, the main method should display the contents of the box and allow the user to substitute any one of the five possible fruits or vegetables for any of the fruits or vegetables selected for the box.  Since recipe brochures are in short supply the farm only supplies brochures if the FreshBox contains duplicate items. For example, if the box contains 2 trays of potato then the farm adds a “how to make mashed potato” recipe to the FreshBox.  After the user is done with substitutions, output the final contents of the box to be delivered.
